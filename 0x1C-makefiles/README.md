Makefiles are special format files used by the make utility to automate the build process of projects. They define a set of tasks to be executed. Hereâ€™s a brief description of key components and concepts in a typical Makefile:

Targets: These are usually the names of files to be created or actions to be performed, such as the compilation of a program. A target can also be a label for a group of commands.

Dependencies: These are files that the target depends on. If any dependency is newer than the target, the commands associated with the target are executed.

Commands: These are the shell commands that make executes to create the target. Commands must be prefixed with a tab character.

Variables: These are used to store values that can be reused throughout the Makefile. They help in making the Makefile more readable and maintainable.

Rules: These define how to build a target from its dependencies. A rule consists of a target, its dependencies, and the commands to create the target.

C - Variadic functions

in this project we are going be using variadic function to solve the project.
 
functions that take an seturn amount of args and int's.

some functions perform operations that can meaningfully accept an unlimited number of arguments

This operation makes sense for any number of values, as long as the length of the array corresponds to that number. Without facilities for variable arguments, you would have to define a separate function for each possible array size.


variadic function which can handle as many arguments as the caller chooses to pass.
